# Magic the Gathering: League Manager Documentation

Hey there! So this repo is really a placeholder for the [wiki](https://github.com/Gnome-Lackey/mtglm-docs/wiki). The only code that will reside here are helper scripts to get people up and running. Before you start looking through any of the code please read the wiki first. Thanks!
